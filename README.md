## Available Scripts

There is a set of scripts available to the project. While in the project directory, you can indeed run:

### `yarn start`

This command runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in the browser; the page will reload as you make edits.
You will also see any lint errors in the console.

### `yarn test`

This command launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `yarn build`

This command builds the app for production and stores the results in the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance: the build is minified, and the filenames include the hashes.\
Finally, your app is ready to be deployed!
See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `yarn run create:faker`

Run this command if you want to regenerate the list of our job offers. The new job offers list is inside the `./publc/jobs.json` file.
